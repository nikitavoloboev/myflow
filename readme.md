> Place to share & store what you use

This is being built as a better place to share and edit configs like [this one](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/config) with others.

## Setup

> [!WARNING]
> This site is built with [blade](https://blade.im) and its yet unreleased DB. It will be possible to run locally very soon. Below are internal setup instructions for now.

Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation). Then run `task setup` & follow instructions until it says `✔️ you are setup`. As mentioned above, no point trying to run this till blade releases public DBs so this is for internal documentation for now.

## Run

`task dev` will start web server, can then open `localhost:`.

## Commands

Run `task` to see all possible commands.
